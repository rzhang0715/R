Introduction: We want to analyze the covid-19 datsaset from Kaggle to find which contries have had the highest number of positive cases against number of testds.

Install the required package and load them
```{r}
library(readr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
```

Set working directory and load the dataset
```{r}
setwd("~/Downloads/Dataquest/R")
covid_df <- read_csv('covid19.csv')
```

Check the charateristics of the dataset
```{r}
print(dim(covid_df))
vector_cols <- colnames(covid_df)
print(vector_cols)
print(typeof(vector_cols))

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(covid_df)

# Display the summary of dataset
glimpse(covid_df)
```
Filter out the country level data
```{r}
covid_df_all_states <- covid_df %>% filter(Province_State == 'All States') %>% select(-Province_State)

covid_df_all_states_daily <- covid_df_all_states %>% select(Date, Country_Region, active, hospitalizedCurr, daily_tested, daily_positive)
```

Find the summaized information from the dataset
```{r}
covid_df_all_states_daily_sum <- covid_df_all_states_daily %>% group_by(Country_Region) %>% summarise(
  tested = sum(daily_tested),
  positive = sum(daily_positive),
  active = sum(active),
  hospitalized = sum(hospitalizedCurr)
) %>% arrange(-tested)
covid_top_10 <- head(covid_df_all_states_daily_sum, 10)
print(covid_top_10)
```

Create the vectors based on the dataframe
```{r}
countries <- covid_top_10$Country_Region
tested_cases <- covid_top_10$tested
positive_cases <- covid_top_10$positive
active_cases <- covid_top_10$active
hospitalized_cases <- covid_top_10$hospitalized

names(tested_cases) <- countries
names(positive_cases) <- countries
names(active_cases) <- countries
names(hospitalized_cases) <- countries

print(positive_cases/tested_cases)
positive_tested_top_3 <- c("United Kingdom" = 0.11, "United States" = 0.10, "Turkey" = 0.08)
```

Create the matrix of top 3
```{r}
united_kingdom <- c(0.11, 1473672, 166909, 0, 0)
united_states <- c(0.10, 17282363, 1877179, 0, 0)
turkey <- c(0.08, 2031192, 163941, 2980960, 0)

covid_mat <- rbind(united_states, united_kingdom, turkey)
colnames(covid_mat) <- c("Ratio", "tested", "positive", "active", "hospitalized")
print(covid_mat)
```


Create a list to answer all questions above
```{r}
question <- "Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?"
answer <- c("Positive tested cases" = positive_tested_top_3)


datasets <- list(
  original = covid_df,
  allstates = covid_df_all_states,
  daily = covid_df_all_states_daily,
  top_10 = covid_top_10
)
matrices <- list(covid_mat)
vectors <- list(vector_cols, countries)

data_structure_list <- list('dataframe' = datasets, 'matrix'=matrices, 'vector' = vectors)

covid_analysis_list <- list(question, answer, data_structure_list)
print(covid_analysis_list[[2]])
```
